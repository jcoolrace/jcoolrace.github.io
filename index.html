      <p>
        Don't relate life to a <i>Choose Your Own Adventure</i> book. All they do is give the illusion of choice. They have predetermined choices with predetermined results. I'd like to relate life to writing the book yourself. The only catch is that you don't know how many pages the book has. Therefore, as a wise man once told me, you must fulfill everything you want to do today, because <i>tomorrow's not promised</i>.

        Now enough deep thought and explore the deep web!
